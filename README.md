## Main Functionalities

UPDATE (April 16, Meeting at Datamap: Djordje, Valery, Roger):
We don't want to mix Health/Testing Status and Contact Tracing with other data. 
The potential abuse risk is too high.        
        
- Time Slot Booking: Reserve your time slot from Home (Shopping, Hospital...)
- <strike>Health/Testing Status</strike>
- Tracking for personal purposes* and for anonymized distances traveled etc. Tracking is optional (and Opt-In)
- Outdoor Pass (if needed)
- <strike>Contact Tracing</strike>

* A tracing app will only tell me the data/time of the infection, so if this was 10 days ago, it might be good for me to check where I was at that time. This way I can better estimate if there was a significant risk or not.
